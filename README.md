## Hackathon ARG
 
An ARG developed within 24 hours for a school hackathon.

# Setting

It is a set in a mostly abandoned and decrepit village. A cult was said to operate here
and we are here to find out what happened.

# Rules

- Everyone works from their own directory and branches unless given permission
- Give the branches and commits clear names so if something breaks it is an easier fix
- Prefix the names of brances with your own name so it stays clear which branch is whose
- No one works on the main
